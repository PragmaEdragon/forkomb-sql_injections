As always push "Request" button and watch what sort of request is it:
"Request is: SELECT * FROM girls WHERE name='' LIMIT 0"

LIMIT 0 will not allow to display anything on the screen.

The only way to baypass is to comment Limit and to create right request:
"Request is: SELECT * FROM girls WHERE name='Lina' #' LIMIT 0"
