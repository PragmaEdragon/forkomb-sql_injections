As always push "Request" button and watch what sort of request is it:
"SELECT * FROM girls WHERE id>''"

Look at the table:

Result:

id	name	height	secret
1	Tsubaki Kasugano	-100	I have a lot of secrets...
2	Ai Mikami	-1	I love Marco
3	Minene Uryuu	163	I'm 20 year old

You cant see there name = 'Yuno Gasai'.

There are 2 ways for solving:

1.
Create this sort of request:
SELECT * FROM girls WHERE id>'-10000000'

2. 
Create this sort of request:
SELECT * FROM girls WHERE id>'0' or name = 'Yuno Gasai'
(0' or name = 'Yuno Gasai). 

Why 0' and or name = ...? 
Is is simple.
You can input ID and then input name. 
Why not "and"?
